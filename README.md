# AgentAI Doc Analyzer: RAG-Powered Document Chatbot

AgentAI Doc Analyzer is a full-stack, AI-driven document analysis chatbot built on a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. It enables users to upload documents and ask natural-language questions, receiving **accurate, context-grounded answers** generated by **GPT-5**, even across large and complex document collections.

This project demonstrates modern **agent-style orchestration**, combining vector search, semantic chunking, tool routing, and LLM reasoning into a scalable, production-ready system.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **RAG-Based Question Answering**  
  Retrieves relevant document context before generation to ensure answers are grounded in source data.

- **GPT-5 Integration**  
  Produces high-quality, multi-step reasoning responses with long-context support (up to 16k tokens).

- **Semantic Search at Scale**  
  Vector embeddings with semantic chunking enable similarity search across **50,000+ document segments** with sub-second retrieval.

- **Agent-Style Tool Orchestration**  
  Implements the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to standardize communication between:
  - RAG pipeline  
  - Web search tools (SerpAPI)  
  - Vector stores and document loaders  

- **Interactive Chat Interface**  
  Maintains conversational context for follow-up questions and iterative exploration.

- **Scalable Backend Services**  
  Express.js microservices handle ingestion, embedding, querying, and rate-limiting for **500+ concurrent users**.
